# What's Cookin'?

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a cookbook application. It allows a user to view all available recipes, as well as favorite recipes to then view on a separate page. I also allows a user to search recipes by name and filter recipes by tag, either in 'all recipes' or in 'favorite recipes.'

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
You can fork the project over and clone it locally.

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We were assigned this project on Friday, December 1st and it was due Monday, December 11th. We are approximately 8 weeks into the Turing Program. This is the first half of the project as a whole.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
* Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Make network requests to retrieve data
* Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

* Dana Zack: A win for me was becoming comfortable writing test suites for happy and sad paths. One challenge for me was being able to add/remove recipes from the 'favorite recipes.'
* Laura Long: One win I can take away from this project is learning how to link a bunch of files together so that they can cummicate with each other. I am also much less afraid of merge conflicts. It was challenging to lose a team member so early into the project but I think Dana and I did a good job of working together despite this. I have a hard time understanding the API still.
