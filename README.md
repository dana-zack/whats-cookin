# What's Cookin'?

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
We built a cookbook application. It allows a user to view all available recipes, as well as favorite recipes to then view on a separate page. It also allows a user to search recipes by name and filter recipes by tag, either in 'all recipes' or in 'favorite recipes.' Finally, it allows users to rate their recipes using a 5 star system.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
Clone this repo, run npm install, then run npm start. <br>

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This was a two part project. The first part was completed between December 1st and it was due Monday, December 11th. The second part was completed between January 2nd and January 8th. In total, we worked on this project for 18 days. We are in module two of Turing School of Software & Development.

### Learning Goals PART 1:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Create a user interface that is easy to use and clearly displays information.
* Write DRY, reusable code that follows SRP and trends toward function purity
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Make network requests to retrieve data
* Collaborate productively and professionally as a team. Ensure all team members are able to be heard and contribute throughout the project.

### Wins + Challenges PART 1:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

* Dana Zack: A win for me was becoming comfortable writing test suites for happy and sad paths. One challenge for me was being able to add/remove recipes from the 'favorite recipes.'
* Laura Long: One win I can take away from this project is learning how to link a bunch of files together so that they can cummicate with each other. I am also much less afraid of merge conflicts. It was challenging to lose a team member so early into the project but I think Dana and I did a good job of working together despite this. I have a hard time understanding the API still. 

### Learning Goals PART 2:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
* Work with a local server and make network requests to API endpoints to retrieve and manipulate data.
* Ensure your app follows best practices for accessibility
* Practice talking about your code and high level technical concepts
* Implement feedback from a usability test to improve product
* Improve group workflow.

### Wins + Challenges PART 2:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
* Laura: I applied a lot of aria accessibility in this project and getting the lighthouse test to 100% was a good feeling. This part of the project was pretty hairy for me, there were a few times I felt like I had no idea what was going on and had to spend time catching up with network requests. I'm happy our group was compatible! Teamwork makes the dreak work.
* Dana Zack: A win for me was improving my debugging skills when we struggled to repair the heart (favorite) button. One challenge for me was learning how to incorporate & understand API error messages (throw new Error for 400s vs. .catch for 500s) within the code.
* Ricky Tran: mproving logic building skills with the star rating system. Styling the hover effects for the stars was a challenge for me but also a win once it was working and looked good!!!!
